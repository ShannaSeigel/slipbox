## What is [Markdown](../mocs/🟣MARKDOWN)?

> It’s a plain text format for writing structured documents, based on formatting conventions from email and usenet. 
> [commonmark.org](https://commonmark.org/)

Developed in 2004, many variations of markdown language exist. Developer John Gruber has an overview of markdown on his website [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#overview)

It is possible to convert between variations or markdown, for example with ❓Zettelkasten/202008021358 Pandoc for .md|Pandoc

> What distinguishes Markdown from many other lightweight markup syntaxes... is its readability. 
> [GitHub](https://github.com)
