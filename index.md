Welcome to my test site, a trial and error experiment in learning how to build modern websites and hosting my ~~ZK/garden/second brain/what-have-you~~ Obsidian vault online.
<br>
*Last update: Sep-5-2020. New updates coming Nov-2020*

## Recent:
- Trying out a browser based preview of local files.
- [A zettel appears!](zets/202007251031-what-is-markdown) Moving some of my preexisting notes here to start testing how to share info online and/or how to organize it.
- I was also working on index notes or "maps of content" (MOCs) previously for organizing bigger groups of notes. Working to update my [content map about Markdown](mocs/%F0%9F%9F%A3MARKDOWN).


#### Other stuffs
- I made a [list of rules](one_pagers/new_format_rules) I need to follow after being used to Bear or Obsidian links.
- I've got an [experience log](one_pagers/xp_log) since I'm not a programmer and have no clue what I'm doing.
- Using the [Minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) for learning.

## Plans for Slipbox Files
- Need to review incoming files from my existing notes for formatting requirements regarding filenames and links.
- Make sure to maintain this structure going forward.
	- Can use the "relative notes" setting to quickly get file names from wikilinks. Can edit link formatting after.
- Goal to keep list of zettels in a flat, single folder in hopes of reducing broken links.
- Still mulling over how to handle organization, landing page, blog, or anything else I'd like to add.
